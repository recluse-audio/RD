/**
 * @brief This class provides a look-up table for different window functions, First just hanning.
 * 
 * The goal is that we look up a value (0 - 1.0) and use that as an amplitude coefficient to create 
 * a way to interpret a single stored buffer of amplitude for various window lengths.
 * 
 * Inspired by ADSR and LFO wavetables I have made in the past.  I hope this saves on processing.  
 * Re-generating the window with each incoming new length (i.e. pitch period) seems expensive.
 * Storing these windows ahead of time feels like it will cause large memory footprint bloat and reduce instance count
 * 
 * These theories are not tested!  But this method is most logical first step for me.
 * 
 * This window lookup table
